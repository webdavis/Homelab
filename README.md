# Homelab

This repository automates my home network setup. This automation is hardware-agnostic, but I
like to run it on small single-board computers like Raspberry Pis.

Think: small computers, big network!

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

- [ ] Maintain a test environment that mirrors my home network for fast, safe deployment.
- [ ] Deploy across multiple operating-systems and CPU architectures.
- [ ] Support both on-metal and cloud deployments.
- [ ] Ensure cross-OS service interoperability.
- [ ] Track [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt)
  configurations in parallel project branches for comparison.

## Technologies Used

Homelab makes use of the following tools:

- **[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/):** Playbooks to configure services on each device.
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/):** Containers that run and manage the
  services.
- **Wrapper Scripts:** Simplify working with Ansible and other tools in this project.

## Development Environment

Follow these steps to ensure your environment is ready to work on this project:

### 1. Prerequisites

> If this is your first time working on this project, follow the instructions in
> [macos-dev-environment.md](./docs/macos-dev-environment.md) first.
>
> The instructions below assume you've done this.

In short, this project requires Python 3 and uses a
[Pyprojectx](https://github.com/pyprojectx/pyprojectx) /
[Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) combo to manage Ansible and related tools.

### 2. Set the Python Version

This project uses [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage and track its Python
version. The current version is specified in the [`.python-version`](./.python-version) file.

Run this command to activate pyenv in your current shell:

```bash
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Once pyenv is activated, it reads the `.python-version` file and activates the Python version
specified there.

> [!Important]
>
> - This command must be run **every time you start a new terminal session** before working on
>   this project.
> - You can run this command from any folder in the project.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

This project uses Pyprojectx and Poetry to manage Python dependencies in a consistent, isolated
environment:

- **Pyprojectx:** Provides the [`./pw`](./pw) wrapper script, ensuring all project tools run
  consistently without needing global installations (including Poetry).
- **Poetry:** manages the Python dependencies used by this project (including Ansible).

Install the dependencies:

```bash
./pw poetry install
```

**Tip:** Make sure you're using the project's Poetry, not a system-wide one:

```bash
./pw which poetry
```

> The output should point to a path like:\
> `<path_to_this_project>/Homelab/.pyprojectx/venvs/main-ab061d9d4f9bea1cc2de64816d469baf-py3.13/bin/poetry`

> [!TIP] Having trouble? Check the [Problems and Solutions](#problems-and-solutions) section.

### 4. Setup Credentials

#### ssh-agent

Ansible uses SSH to connect to managed nodes.

To avoid repeatedly entering the private key passphrase, load your SSH private key into
ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

> _Other tools may provide an ssh-agent service. I personally use
> [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)._

#### Ansible Vault Password

Homelab manages secrets with
[Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_using_encrypted_content.html)
Before executing any Playbooks, Ansible ensures it can access the vault.

Ansible Vault fetches the vault password using the \[`vault.password.py`\](./vault.password.py
script, which reads it from the `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable.

You can set this variable permanently by adding the following to your shell configuration file
(e.g., `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD='xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Alternatively, you can create a `vault.secret` file with the following contents:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD='xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Then, load it into your current shell session with:

```bash
source vault.secret
```

### 5. Verify Ansible Connection

Before you do anything else, verify that you can connect to both the managing node (your
`localhost`) and a managed node using Ansible's `ping` module:

**Managing Node:**

```bash
./pw poetry run ansible localhost -m ping
```

**Managed Node:**

```bash
./pw poetry run ansible unprovisioned_yoshimo -m ping
```

> [!TIP] See [`inventory.yml`](./inventory.yml) for other managed nodes.

Now you should be good to go!

Follow these steps every time you return to the project. Once done, youâ€™re ready to run Ansible
plays or work on the project safely.

## Ansible Roles

This project uses the following Ansible roles. Most of these will eventually be moved to their
own repositories.

### Security

To run this role, your playbook must include the following:

- `become: yes`: required to execute tasks requiring administrative access.
- `gather_facts: yes`: to collect essential system details before executing tasks.

For example:

```yaml
- name: Configure security settings
  hosts: yoshimo
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Import security role
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: security
```

## Problems & Solutions

### I Upgraded Homebrew and it Broke my Python Virtual Environment

#### Problem

After updating Homebrew, your `.pyprojectx/` environment may break. For example you might get a
`dyld` error like this one:

```bash
$ ./pw poetry run ansible unprovisioned_yoshimo -m ping

dyld[74408]: Library not loaded: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.13/3.13.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/Python
...
```

#### Cause

The `.pyprojectx/` environment was created _before the correct Python version was activated
with pyenv_, so it linked to a Homebrew-managed Python that may no longer exist after the
update.

#### Solution

Rebuild the `.pyprojectx/` environment using the correct Python version.

1. Remove the broken environment:

```bash
rm -rf .pyprojectx/
```

2. Activate the shell environment for pyenv:

```bash
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

3. Recreate the environment:

```bash
pyprojectx bootstrap
```

After this, your Python virtual environment will use the pyenv-managed Python, resolving the
Homebrew-related break.
